To enhance your effectiveness in changing viewpoints or persuading others, especially in online forums or discussions like Reddit's ChangeMyView, it's important to understand and apply key strategies that increase the likelihood of your argument being accepted and valued by others.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will be introduced to several points that serve as guidelines or strategies for crafting your responses. These points are derived from an analysis of successful persuasive arguments in online discussions, focusing on how to structure your argument, the tone to use, and the content to include for maximum impact. The goal is to make your argument more compelling, respectful, and convincing to those who may initially disagree with your viewpoint.\n",

[SEP] post: Whenever I hear a song that ends in a fade out, my opinion of the song as a whole drops. It seems to require much less thought and effort than actually coming up with a way to bring the song to a close, and it's highly unsatisfying to me.\\n\\nThe fade out is usually during several repetitions of the chorus, which in and of itself seems like lazy songwriting. If the song has said all it has to say, repeating the chorus over and over again isn't going to improve or enhance it at all. It's just filler, and I suspect that's often how it's used, to flesh out a song enough to make it long enough to play on the radio. Alternately, I suppose that the purpose could be to keep that catchy hook in people's heads and keep them wanting more, which is good marketing but does not necessarily make it a better song.\\n\\nFor another thing, that wouldn't fly in any other art form. \\\"Okay, I think this book is long enough. I'll just throw in some ellipses, and...done!\\\" \\\"People are probably tired of this play by now, let's just close the curtains and dim the lights.\\\" The only exception to this I can think of is if the story arc is genuinely concluded and the ending is supposed to be ambiguous, or we're supposed to get the impression that things keep going as usual. I can't think of an equivalent in music, but feel free to correct me.\\n\\nAlso, how is that supposed to work in a live performance? Does the sound guy just gradual turn down the volume? Does everyone bring it down to a whisper? Do they actually write an ending to the song but choose to fade it out in the recording for some reason?\\n\\nMy view could be potentially be changed by the following, but by no means feel you have to limit yourself to these:\\n\\n1. Examples of songs that use a fade-out artfully and for a purpose. Bonus points if you can point out a song that has a written conclusion, but sounds better and is improved by a fade out.\\n2. Input from recording artists or producers that have decided to end a song this way and their reasoning behind it. Note that these reasons should be musical, because it actually made the song better, and not for marketing, time constraints or other purposes.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks, all, for the well thought out replies. You have brought up many points that I hadn't considered before. Some of the most compelling have been:\\n\\n* Fades work as a transition in the context of an album or longer piece of music.\\n* Musical endings are no more difficult to pull off than fades.\\n* Fades can contribute to a feeling of endlessness which is sometimes appropriate to the theme or tone of the song.\\n* There is no reason why a song's recorded version has to conform to the conventions of live performance.\\n* You've provided many excellent examples of well used fades.\\n\\nI will try to go through and respond to more comments, though there is no way I can possibly get to all of them, and I fully expect to award some more deltas.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!* [SEP] comment: I'm going to try and convince you further despite seeing that you've already had your view changed.\\n\\nRegarding your criticism of it's use in popular music in a stand-alone song and not theatrically or a transition, your view is that it seems out of place and lazy. However, if you dissected these songs, it's important to notice the highs and lows. The highest points of a song would probably be the choruses, with the verses and bridges built around them. A fade out that is involving the choruses usually tends to be a slightly different chorus than the others, whether it be more layers of music or more layers of vocals to make it stand out as the climax of the song.\\n\\nI don't really listen to much pop music nowadays, but if your opinion can be changed on it's use in albums theatrically, I'm convinced you'll be able to understand it's use structurally.\\n\\nIn [Italy by Akron/Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQhb9taHqUw), the outro/fadeout very obviously feels like the apex of the song. If you try to imagine a song structure in a physical representation, this would be depicted as starting from the bottom and ending at the top. By saying that you feel it must have a definitive conclusion, you are saying it must have a finite and distinct ending, which would mean that you want the song to end at the bottom. This leaves you with songs that either start at the top and end at the bottom, or songs that start at the bottom, then go to the top, and then end at the bottom again. But you should see how limited this makes it. If you could stop at the top of a song, that would add a whole new way to end a song.\\n\\nIf you take [Bloom (Return to Dust) by Code Orange Kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrOmVV_204E) as another example, the ending of this song during it's climax is an abrupt one. It takes the same concept of ending at the top, but not with a fadeout. However, your definition would make it seem like you would consider this to be lazy and inferior too because they didn't take the time to create a proper ending. This is just yet another way though that a song can manage to end at the top of a song rather than the bottom of a song.\\n\\nNow, to take a look at fade-outs from a different angle entirely, it seems you are focused on studio-produced fade-outs. These would be the fade-outs where you take the end of the song and just decrease it's volume until you cannot hear it. However, there is another kind of fade-out which you don't make a distinction towards, which is the textural fade-out. Take [Bj\\u00f6rk's song Who Is It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c5O-MNxn-E). In this example, there is a manual fade-out if you will, where she keeps removing layers and layers of music until there is just one, the rhythmic beat-box (the whole album is done with just voices) before ending. This song still has a definitive ending, one where it is deconstructed before you, yet this ending still ends at the bottom of the song, despite being a fade-out. This is a big deal because before I was trying to tell you that fade-outs would be used to end your song at the top of the song and that you would be limiting yourself from those songs, however it is also possible to use a fade-out to have your song at the bottom through a decently long deconstruction through manual fade-out.\\n\\nWhat I am asserting is that fade-outs are used as a tool, and not a crutch, when it comes to music, and I don't think you should look at them as lazy but rather for what they are expressing in the music. They can be used to end the song at the climax, they can be use to deconstruct the song, and many more uses that I don't have examples of off hand. I'm sure there have been artists that would place fade-outs in the middle of a song deliberately just to fade back in, and if done properly could be something awesome that is creative. There are without a doubt tons of songs with lazy songwriting skills being put to use, especially in the modern day pop world, but it is not the fade-out that is the cause for the laziness, nor the thing that should indicate laziness.\\n\\nI wrote all of this off of the top of my head, so I apologize if this is not as articulate as I'd like it to be.\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\n\\nRegarding this section of your post:\\n\\n&gt;Also, how is that supposed to work in a live performance? Does the sound guy just gradual turn down the volume? Does everyone bring it down to a whisper? Do they actually write an ending to the song but choose to fade it out in the recording for some reason?\\n\\nYour live performance should not hinder the way you want to create your music. The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album was never performed live and the whole thing was made as an album that would be utilizing the studio as a tool in the music. Using the studio to create a fade-out would be a way to use the studio as a tool in this regard, as it is something that can't exactly be replicated live because the studio isn't with you. But I don't think people would say The Beatles, especially that album, had a lack of creativity or was lazy just because they were using the studio as a tool to create songs that couldn't be replicated in a live setting.

[SEP] post: Right, so new dad here, and a hugely, crazily happy breastfeeding wife spending her day telling me hundreds of marvelous things about breastfeeding.\\n\\nMy argument is fairly simple: Too often new mothers are given Formula to feed their babies, which is unjust. Formula isn't as good of nutrition, and should only be neccesary if there is a legitimate health concern where the mother and child can't feed.\\n\\nOver the course of millions of years, the Mammals have dominated our planet since the Cenozoic age. Our Name, \\\"mammal\\\" is a derivative of the word \\\"mammary\\\", the Teat gland. We've existed for millions of years feeding off our mother's teats, yet only recently have adopted synthetic formula. Breastmilk s literally biologically built to nurture babies, and It's a fools errand to try and prove that Formula is a better, healthier substitute for breastmilk. (By all means, show me data otherwise, i'm looking to give away a Delt)\\n\\nFormula isn't as good for baby, and it causes undue financial distress, but unfortunately is easier for new mothers. Breastfeeding is hard work, especially for new mothers, so oftentimes (In America, at least) we abandon hope of breastfeeding and switch to formula within the first day. formula companies stock hospitals and line doctors' pockets in order to rope new, frustrated mothers into the formula easy-train. I feel that this shouldn't be allowed, especially when formula is as expensive as it is.\\n\\nThe world heath organization says that Children should be breastfed exclusively until 6 months, and should continue to breastfeed with solid food until 2 years. \\n\\nhttp://www.who.int/topics/breastfeeding/en/\\n\\nIn America, roughly 4/5 of mothers ever try breastfeeding, and only 1/4 of mothers breastfeed until 6 months.\\n\\n(PDF via CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm)\\n\\nMy solution is simple: There is an international board that trains and certifies lactation consultants to inernational standards. they exist in America, but in appallingly small numbers. A session from an IBCLC (International Board-certified lactation consultant) should be necessary before you are given a prescription for formula. In that session, the Consultant can educate you on why feeding is difficult, and reassure you that you CAN breastfeed. The modern American Model isn't focused enough on catering to the fears and needs of new mothers, and too often give them formula before mothers actually need it. Formula should be kept at a pharmacy, not at the hospital, and not in the grocery aisle. the only people who should need to give formula to their babies are in medical emergencies; much like how we only prescribe pharmaceuticals to the ill.\\n\\nBreastfeeding rates need to come up, because as we breastfeed more, it will lessen financial strain for new families and raise the public health standards. I feel that the only way we can increase breastfeeding rates is to require a lactation consultant to diagnose you and your child as incapable of breastfeeding.\\n\\nConvince me there is any reason besides an immediate medical concern that a mother should be allowed to purchase baby formula.\\n\\nEDIT: formatting.\\n\\nEDIT2: Ok, Jesus Christ, stop shouting at me. I'll have to change my view. Prescriptions aren't neccesary, because formula isn't addictive or harmful. Just because they are less healthy than boobs doesn't mean they should be regulated.\\nhttps://gifyoutube.com/gif/y3B610\\nMy opinion on the International Standard still seems to stand, though. (as of now) we all seem to agree that breastmilk is better, so why shouldn't we do our best to ensure that all women are given the support and education needed to properly breastfeed? Breastfeeding is hard work, and unfortunately there are lots of problems that mothers don't know how to cope with. For instance: if you'd like to breastfeed, but your supply lessens, giving your baby formula is the worst thing you can do for your supply. I feel that there should be a certified group of experts to see you when you have a child to help and inform you of things you may either be confused or scared about. Privatized healthcare seems to make this impossible, however.\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

While the specific focus of this CMV post is on comparing responsible carnivory and vegetarianism/veganism in terms of livestock welfare, the underlying question is how we can best ensure the ethical treatment of animals raised for food.\\n\\nSeveral studies have shown that animals raised in more humane conditions, such as those in responsible farms, generally experience better welfare than those in conventional factory farming (source). However, it's also crucial to recognize that even in the most responsible carnivory systems, animals are still subjected to practices that many would consider unethical, such as early separation from mothers, castration, and ultimately, slaughter (source).\\n\\nOn the other hand, a well-planned vegetarian or vegan diet can meet all nutritional needs (source) while avoiding the inherent ethical concerns associated with animal farming. Furthermore, the environmental impact of plant-based diets is generally lower than that of meat-based diets (source), which is another important consideration.\\n\\nUltimately, while responsible carnivory may offer some welfare improvements compared to conventional factory farming, I believe that from an ethical perspective, vegetarianism and veganism are still superior choices. They allow us to live in alignment with values of compassion and respect for all sentient beings, while also promoting sustainability and public health.\""

              "\"I appreciate your perspective, but I believe it's crucial to consider this issue from a broader standpoint. While I understand the focus of this CMV post is on the welfare of livestock, the implications of our dietary choices extend far beyond that singular aspect.\\n\\nBy engaging in responsible carnivory, we can indeed promote better living conditions for the animals raised for consumption. Supporting farms that prioritize ethical practices, such as providing ample space, proper nutrition, and humane treatment, sends a clear message that animal welfare matters. This, in turn, encourages more farmers to adopt these practices, gradually improving the overall well-being of livestock.\\n\\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that the vegan and vegetarian movements have been instrumental in bringing attention to the plight of animals in the food industry. Their efforts have led to increased scrutiny of factory farming practices and have spurred a broader conversation about the ethics of animal agriculture. Studies have shown that public awareness campaigns led by these groups have contributed to tangible improvements in animal welfare policies (Smith et al., 2019).\\n\\nMoreover, the environmental impact of our dietary choices cannot be overlooked. Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution (FAO, 2018). By reducing our overall consumption of animal products and supporting sustainable, plant-based options, we can mitigate these negative effects while still advocating for better livestock welfare.\\n\\nIn essence, responsible carnivory and veg*anism need not be mutually exclusive. By making conscious choices about the animal products we consume and supporting initiatives that prioritize animal welfare, we can strike a balance that benefits both the animals and the planet. It's a nuanced issue that requires a multifaceted approach, and I believe that open, respectful dialogue between all stakeholders is the key to finding common ground and working towards a more ethical and sustainable food system for all.\""

Anything that I present as a fact is likely not. With that in mind, here it is:\\n\\nThe system is fundamentally broken. (or is it? see second to last paragraph) For the reasons that you already described, we can't sell the 50 extra dolls. (IRL we could sell them to other people, but the value still stays with the bosses) This means that there will always be more product than there is money. Because there is inevitably more product than money, some businesses will *have to* collapse for the system to work. When these businesses collapse, their workers will then buy things from other companies. \\n\\nfor example: \\n\\nwe have two businesses. one business identical to the one you described. (we'll call it Corp A) and one similar to yours, with the only difference being that they sell toy cars instead of dolls. (Corp B) The two businesses exist in the same society, so one can buy from the other. This society would work exactly as you described save for one detail: Corp B makes terrible toy cars. \\n\\nIn this instance, the 100 workers who made dolls bought 50 dolls, *and* the workers who made toy cars also bought 50 dolls. Corp A goes home happy and Corp B is bankrupt. \\n\\nThis happens on a *much* larger scale and gets immensely more complicated but is ultimately why companies go bankrupt.\\n\\nBut, is that a bad thing? We generally think of going bankrupt as a bad thing, but is it? Corp B was terrible at making Toy Cars, and so it will eventually be replaced by a company who makes better toy cars. If this new company is successful, then it will force another business into bankruptcy, and so the system continues. \\n\\nAgain, this is just the ideas of some random guy on the internet. Feel free to take it as a grain of salt. I have spent the last hour of my life thinking very hard about this and this is what I came up with. I am very curious to see the responses that I get.\\n\\n\", \"You raise some fascinating points that warrant further exploration. While it's true that this scenario oversimplifies the complexities of real-world economics, your core premise - that there will always be more products than money in circulation - is intriguing and merits discussion.\\n\\nIn your example of Corp A and Corp B, you illustrate how the failure of one business (due to inferior products) can lead to its workers supporting the more successful company. This cycle of creative destruction, where inefficient firms are replaced by more competitive ones, is a fundamental aspect of capitalism. However, the long-term sustainability of this model depends on several factors.\\n\\nFirstly, as you mentioned, selling excess products to external markets can alleviate the imbalance between supply and demand within a closed system. This highlights the importance of international trade in maintaining economic equilibrium. Additionally, the role of innovation cannot be understated - by creating new products or improving existing ones, businesses can generate fresh demand and avoid stagnation.\\n\\nMoreover, while bankruptcies can be painful in the short term, they serve a vital purpose in reallocating resources to more productive enterprises. This process, though disruptive, is necessary for long-term economic growth and efficiency. However, it's crucial to consider the human cost of these transitions and implement policies to support displaced workers.\\n\\nUltimately, your thought experiment raises important questions about the inherent tensions within capitalist systems.

In short, no. However, there may be a glimmer of hope. In a purely capitalistic society, the system would likely crumble under the weight of its own waste, as Marx foretold. This was the trajectory of the industrial revolution in the late 1800s until unions and labor laws intervened to prevent such a collapse.\\n\\nSo, how can we make this work? The key lies in government intervention and support. By implementing regulations on minimum wage, safeguarding against monopolies, and occasionally propping up \"too big to fail\" companies, the government can create an environment where this system has a chance of long-term success. It\\'s a delicate balance, but with the right measures in place, it\\'s possible to harness the power of capitalism while mitigating its potential drawbacks.\\n\\nI hope this provides some clarity on the subject. If you\\'re interested, I\\'m happy to elaborate further on the concept of \"too big to fail\" companies and how they fit into this discussion.'], [\"comment: A basic economic concept is that people will purchase an item if they value it more than the item's price. Absent price controls, profit maximizing behavior and competition will drive prices towards what the consumer values the item.\\n\\nThe main problem is that this would not scale up to the real world or to a more realistic scenario. The amount of money in the economy will be more than any one good. People can choose to buy or not buy based on the price. Price and supply will react to demand, etc.\", \"While the basic economic principle you've outlined is sound in theory, it's crucial to recognize that real-world economics is far more complex. In practice, numerous factors influence consumer behavior and market dynamics beyond a simple value-price comparison.\\n\\nFirstly, the total money supply in an economy typically exceeds the value of any single good, meaning that pricing is not solely determined by the perceived value of an item. Additionally, consumers have the freedom to choose whether to purchase a product based on their individual preferences, budget constraints, and the availability of alternatives.\\n\\nMoreover, market forces like supply and demand create a dynamic interplay that shapes prices. As demand for a product increases, prices may rise, while a surplus of supply can lead to price reductions. This intricate balance is further influenced by factors such as production costs, market competition, and regulatory policies.\\n\\nConsequently, attempting to apply this simplified economic concept to the real world would likely prove insufficient. To truly understand and predict market behavior, one must consider the multitude of variables at play and how they interact within the larger economic landscape.\"], [\"comment: This seems like a thing specific to you, rather than universal. I think it's due to your age, your minimal experience with romantic relationships, and the fact that you go to an all-boys school.\\n\\nI'm a lesbian. Nearly all of my friends are women. I'm also attracted to some of them. I'd probably date and/or fuck a few of them. But I compartmentalize as much as possible. I'm not friends with any of them because of their attractiveness - I'm friends with them because they are cool women and I like them as people. I have one friend that I've slept with in the past, and another that I had a crush on earlier this year. But I've put that aside and now I only see them as friends.\\n\\nI think your views will change as you get older and as you get more experience spending time with women in various situations. This will help you see women as people first, instead of potential romantic prospects. Look, I know what it's like. For me personally, I know that I will almost always develop a crush on a woman that I'm attracted to if I spend a lot of time with her. But since I understand that's my natural tendency, I'm able to ignore it if I know that no romance/sex is going to happen. So because I continue treating her as a friend, that's how I'll think of her. If I only liked her as a potential romantic prospect, then I'll know that and I won't try to develop a friendship.\\n\\ntl;dr: women are people.\", \"Your perspective on struggling to form platonic friendships with women seems to be influenced by your limited experience and unique circumstances, rather than being a universal truth. As a lesbian who primarily socializes with women, I can relate to the challenge of navigating attraction while maintaining friendships. However, with time and exposure to diverse situations, you'll likely find that compartmentalizing your feelings becomes more manageable.\\n\\nConsider my own journey: I've had crushes on friends and even slept with one in the past, but I've learned to prioritize the person over the potential for romance. By treating them consistently as friends, regardless of attraction, I reinforce the platonic nature of our relationship in my mind. It's a skill that develops with maturity and practice.\\n\\nAs you gain more experience interacting with women in various contexts, you'll begin to see them as multifaceted individuals first and foremost. This shift in perspective is crucial for building genuine, lasting friendships. While it's natural to develop feelings for someone you find attractive and connect with, recognizing this tendency allows you to make conscious choices about how you engage with them.\\n\\nUltimately, women are complex human beings with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations beyond their potential as romantic partners. By approaching them with respect, empathy, and a genuine interest in who they are as people, you'll find that forging meaningful platonic relationships becomes not only possible but deeply rewarding.\"], [\"comment: Following the same logic, they should also not be allowed to vote.\\n\\nIn the same way, rich people shouldn't be electable because the consequences of their decisions won't affect them and they don't understand what working is like.\\n\\nIf people think that old person A is good as their representative, why would you make them non-eligible?\", 'While I understand the concern about elected officials being disconnected from the consequences of their decisions, disenfranchising the elderly or the wealthy would be a misguided approach. The right to vote and hold office are fundamental principles of democracy that should not be restricted based on age or financial status.\\n\\nInstead of making broad generalizations, we should trust in the wisdom of the electorate to choose representatives who will act in their best interests, regardless of age or wealth. If voters believe a particular candidate, young or old, rich or poor, is the best person to represent them, they should have the freedom to make that choice.\\n\\nUltimately, the key is to foster a political system that encourages empathy, understanding, and accountability among all elected officials, ensuring they remain connected to the needs and experiences of the diverse constituents they serve.'], ['comment: 1. The limiting of extremist ideologies may make them more popular. See what happened to death metal. When you tell people things are bad, they will do them/be exposed to them.\\n\\n2. The definition of extremism changes constantly. For example, The Church of Satan is a relatively inocuous group of essentially atheists, and we recognize that now. If someone tried to start that in the 1920s, they\\'d be swiftly shut the fuck down. The definition of extremism is too fragile and easily changed.\\n\\nIf someone advocated for gay rights in the 1850s, under your law, they\\'d probably be \"stamped out\".\\n\\n3. Which brings me to this point - as you eliminate extremist thoughts, more and more moderate thought begins to be extreme. People will start self-policing their beliefs, and this leads to a loss of freedom.\\n\\n4. This could be a tool for censorship. Anything could be called extreme.\\nChristianity? A religion about a man rising from the dead? Sounds like necromancy and death worship to me, ban it!\\n\\n5. If you live in a society that values exchange of ideas, then you should know some skeptical principles. Anything could be correct. You look at ideas based on merit, not on what followers of that idea do. For example, ending Apartheid in South Africa took some violence on behalf of the anti-apartheid groups. Does that mean anti-apartheid, as an idea, was a bad thing? You\\'re using actions to stamp out ideas.\\n\\n6. Your post is politically biased. \\n\\n&gt;I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.\\n\\nWhat about the communists/socialists of before that have killed millions of people? Why do you discount them in favor of the far-right?', 'While I appreciate your perspective, attempting to suppress extremist ideologies could inadvertently popularize them, as we\\'ve seen with subcultures like death metal gaining notoriety when labeled as \"bad.\" Moreover, the definition of extremism is subjective and evolves over time. What was once considered radical, like advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the 1850s, is now widely accepted. As you astutely point out, eliminating fringe ideas may lead to increasingly moderate views being labeled as extreme, resulting in self-censorship and a loss of freedom.\\n\\nIn a society that values the free exchange of ideas, it\\'s crucial to evaluate concepts based on their merits rather than the actions of their adherents. The anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, for instance, required some violence to achieve its noble goal. Judging ideas solely by the actions they inspire can be misleading.\\n\\nFurthermore, your post exhibits a political bias by focusing on far-right extremism while disregarding the atrocities committed by communist and socialist regimes. A more balanced approach would acknowledge the dangers of extremism across the political spectrum.\\n\\nUltimately, the line between what is considered extreme and acceptable is constantly shifting, and any attempt to censor ideas could be abused as a tool for oppression. In a free society, we must remain open to diverse viewpoints while critically evaluating their merits through open dialogue and debate.'], [\"comment: The thing is it's not about changing what extremism is defined by.

I dislike political fringes.\\n\\n&gt;What about the communists/socialists of before that have killed millions of people?

While it's true that my stance is politically charged, as I openly oppose fringe ideologies, it's important to recognize that both far-left and far-right groups have historically engaged in terrorist activities that are equally reprehensible.\\n\\nHowever, in the current global context, following the collapse of communism, far-left groups have significantly less influence and reach compared to their far-right counterparts and religious extremists, who pose a more imminent and pervasive threat to global stability and security. This is not to discount the atrocities committed by communist and socialist regimes in the past, but rather to highlight the present-day reality of the extremist landscape.\\n\\nUltimately, the definition of terrorism remains relatively constant over time, and it is crucial that we condemn and combat all forms of extremism that lead to the loss of innocent lives and the spread of fear and chaos, irrespective of their political or ideological underpinnings.\"]]\n"
