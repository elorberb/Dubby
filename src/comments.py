Would it have been more difficult for them to stand in line, though?  I think the best solution for them would have been to call ahead, explain, and ask if they could reserve two seats, perhaps by paying a premium, or maybe hire someone to wait in line for them?  Just spit-balling.
You're correct that it's only 25% obesity, and I agree that there's some level of personal responsibility.  But especially if we start to talk about health-care costs, it's indefensible to say that the government has the right to massively subsidize corn, and then go ahead and over-tax the people whom that subsidy is directly harming.,

That's true, it's important for people to learn how real life differs from what they can read in textbooks, and the only way to do that would be through reproducing those experiments. I see they would not have a full grasp of what they would be learning. âˆ†,

I personally think heels, jewelry, nails, and waxing are a problem with society. I think both men and women are to blame for it.
I'm an INTJ, so maybe my perspective just isn't in line with the popular opinion, but if it's so much work to keep up, perhaps women need to just stop, and men need to stop demanding it.
At one time being overweight was in (dark ages), at one time tiedye was the thing to wear, at one time talking about one's mother was a guaranteed fistfight. All those things changed, perhaps it's time for society to shift into something that's more about comfort, less about timesinks like makeup.
I give you points for the point about eye shadow and lipstick, but that still doesn't address the fact that you're changing something about yourself to impress others or make yourself feel better about yourself, which is what I'm calling out as a self-esteem issue.
Edit: I extended the olive branch to her immediately, I never intended for it to be a heated discussion (nor was it in my opinion). She accused me of judging and demonizing her for every time we had hung out in the past because she was wearing makeup (I honestly had never noticed her wearing any...) and won't respond to text/email/facebook/anything.
If today she decided to resume being friends I wouldn't even desire an apology, but for whatever reason I don't see it happening.,

Thanks or your post, an I get where you're coming from. However I disagree the emotional impact of the game being weakened on a "perfect" run simply because it's perfect. If anything, for me, it's a far better feeling and emotional payoff coming from something like a sole survivor Shepard who vowed never to lose another man and seeing that through to the end. I know that's a specific RP instance, so heres a cold hard fact: if a character dies early you will totally miss out on any content involving them in the future, meaning that *you just get less content*.,

Record 4:
If he was fighting crimes for ego's sake wouldn't it make more sense for him to  not have a secret identity?
Anyway, the ultimate in egotism would be to kill someone that you feel wronged you for your own selfish reasons, acting as judge, jury, and executioner for someone when the only person to appoint you to that position is yourself.
Certainly it would be more pragmatic to kill someone who might reoffend, but there's a reason that super heroes don't do it just as there's a reason why we don't have have every criminal sentenced to the death penalty IRL.,

I would argue that unless everyone is moving at a relatively uniform speed, you're going to be encouraging traffic accidents. Regardless of what you, personally, consider to be reckless, there are going to be people who consider whatever speed you think is appropriate to be painfully slow, and people who consider it to be recklessly fast. 
Speed limits aren't arbitrary, mostly. They take into account traffic volume, road shape, the possibility of people merging... Even though it sometimes doesn't seem like it, the roads are a complex system that must be managed as such; letting everyone do what they want is only inviting accidents.,

Let me address this by pointing one thing out: numbers don't lie. With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that aren't a fan of. Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it. You're entirely in your right to feel that CoD is overrated, and personally it seems futile to change this view. You like what you like. I can only provide objective points to maybe calibrate your perspective.
So back to numbers don't lie. Consider the goal the creators of CoD have. To make money. And they consistently perform this goal well year after year. Now, you're an executive of Activision-Blizzard. Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, "for change's sake."? You only run risk and very little reward. If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula. 
Really, your view of "overrated and overhyped" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games. But this view is separate from the objective success of the series. If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is. The idiom, "Don't fix what isn't broken" comes to mind. There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc. I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it? Probably not. You have a bias against the series. Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD? It makes no sense.
The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive. Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release. It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time (and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game. Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldn't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it. They aren't a charity, so gamers aren't entitled to it. ,

If you haven't been to any parties how do you know thats what people are like? The Internet? Did you just make it up? There are a fair few cunts at any party, but only in very very rare cases is it just a cunt party. ^^not ^^like ^^that
The vast majority of people (in my experience) were people who **do** work and **do** have jobs etc. just blowing off some steam. I also knew a fair few people who held, what seems to be, your opinion of "oh no, all they do is drink neat alcohol and headbutt the wall screaming YOLO at the top of their voices, and thats not for me" Which is just plain bollocks, and they didn't really fit in great at Uni (or College) because they were shit at talking to strangers. 
My advice, if you care, is to go to the most questionable party you can find. Meet some people, smoke a joint (it won't kill you) and try your hardest to get your dick wet, all while seeing how much you can drink before you physically can't drink anymore (on a weekend or during the holidays preferably) and if you survive your one step closer to becoming everything you have ever wanted. 
**OR** (this is a stroke of genius btw) think of it as training your social skills: if you can get off with some random girl you just met, or one of the 'cool kids' says something along the lines of "your alright actually mate" you get an A+ and should reward yourself appropriately (with another party perhaps?),
